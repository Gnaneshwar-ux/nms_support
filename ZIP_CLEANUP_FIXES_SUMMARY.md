# Zip Cleanup Feature - Bug Fixes Summary

## Issues Found and Fixed

### Issue 1: Cleanup Button Not Visible on Project Switch ‚ùå ‚Üí ‚úÖ
**Problem:** 
- Cleanup button didn't appear when switching to a project that has tracked zip files
- Button visibility was checked too early in the loading process

**Root Cause:**
- `updateCleanupButtonVisibility()` was called before the project was fully loaded
- Change tracking service was in loading mode, preventing UI updates

**Fix:**
```java
// BEFORE: Called during loading (too early)
updateCleanupButtonVisibility(project.hasServerZipFiles());

// AFTER: Called in finally block after loading completes
finally {
    changeTrackingService.endLoading();
    
    // Update cleanup button visibility AFTER loading completes
    ProjectEntity currentProject = mainController.getSelectedProject();
    if (currentProject != null) {
        updateCleanupButtonVisibility(currentProject.hasServerZipFiles());
        logger.info("Cleanup button visibility updated: " + currentProject.hasServerZipFiles());
    }
}
```

**Files Modified:**
- `ProjectDetailsController.java` - Lines 258-268

### Issue 2: Zip Files Not Tracked When User Cancels ‚ùå ‚Üí ‚úÖ
**Problem:**
- When user cancelled during zip creation, the zip file was never added to tracking
- If cancellation happened DURING zip creation, file remained on server untracked

**Root Cause:**
```java
// BEFORE: Tracking happened AFTER createZipFile() returned
remoteZipFilePath = createZipFile(ssh, remoteDir, progressCallback, project);

// If user cancelled inside createZipFile(), this code never executed:
if (remoteZipFilePath != null) {
    project.addServerZipFile(remoteZipFilePath, "Java download - " + purpose);
}
```

**Fix:**
```java
// AFTER: Tracking happens IMMEDIATELY inside createZipFile()
private static String createZipFile(...) throws Exception {
    String remoteZipFilePath = String.format("/tmp/downloaded_java_%d.zip", timestamp);
    
    // Track this file for cleanup in SSH session
    ssh.trackRemoteFile(remoteZipFilePath);
    
    // CRITICAL: Track immediately in project entity so it's recorded even if cancelled
    project.addServerZipFile(remoteZipFilePath, "Java download - " + ssh.getPurpose());
    LoggerUtil.getLogger().info("‚úì Tracked zip file in project entity: " + remoteZipFilePath);
    
    // Save project data immediately to persist tracking
    try {
        ProjectManager.getInstance().saveData();
        LoggerUtil.getLogger().info("‚úì Project data saved after tracking zip file");
    } catch (Exception e) {
        LoggerUtil.getLogger().warning("Failed to save project data: " + e.getMessage());
    }
    
    // Now proceed with actual zip creation...
    // If cancelled, file is already tracked and cleanup button will appear!
}
```

**Files Modified:**
- `SFTPDownloadAndUnzip.java` - Lines 430-440

### Issue 3: Project Data Not Persisted After Tracking Changes ‚ùå ‚Üí ‚úÖ
**Problem:**
- Zip file tracking changes weren't saved to disk immediately
- On app restart, tracked zips were lost
- Button visibility would be incorrect after restart

**Fix:**
Added auto-save after EVERY tracking change:

1. **When zip is tracked:**
```java
project.addServerZipFile(path, purpose);
ProjectManager.getInstance().saveData(); // ‚Üê Added
```

2. **When zip is deleted:**
```java
project.removeServerZipFile(path);
ProjectManager.getInstance().saveData(); // ‚Üê Added
```

3. **When cleanup occurs after cancellation:**
```java
project.removeServerZipFile(path);
ProjectManager.getInstance().saveData(); // ‚Üê Added
```

**Locations Updated:**
- After successful tracking (line 436)
- After successful deletion (line 274)
- After cleanup on cancellation (lines 96, 256, 350, 569, 590)
- After cleanup on error (line 350)

## How The Complete Flow Works Now

### Normal Successful Flow:
```
1. User starts setup
2. createZipFile() creates path: /tmp/downloaded_java_123.zip
3. ‚úì IMMEDIATELY tracked in ProjectEntity
4. ‚úì IMMEDIATELY saved to disk
5. Zip creation proceeds (45 seconds...)
6. Download completes
7. ‚úì Zip deleted from server
8. ‚úì Removed from tracking
9. ‚úì Saved to disk
10. Button hides (no zips tracked)
```

### User Cancels During Zip Creation:
```
1. User starts setup
2. createZipFile() creates path: /tmp/downloaded_java_123.zip
3. ‚úì IMMEDIATELY tracked in ProjectEntity
4. ‚úì IMMEDIATELY saved to disk
5. Zip creation starts...
6. ‚ö†Ô∏è USER CANCELS (during zipping)
7. ‚úì Cleanup attempts to delete zip
8. ‚úì If delete succeeds: removed from tracking + saved
9. ‚úì If delete fails: zip stays tracked + saved
10. ‚úì Button APPEARS if zip still tracked
11. ‚úì User can use cleanup dialog to verify & delete
```

### User Switches Projects:
```
1. User selects different project
2. ProjectDetailsController.loadProjectDetails() called
3. Project data loaded into UI fields
4. finally block executes
5. ‚úì changeTrackingService.endLoading() called
6. ‚úì updateCleanupButtonVisibility() called
7. ‚úì Checks project.hasServerZipFiles()
8. ‚úì Shows/hides button accordingly
9. ‚úì Logs: "Cleanup button visibility updated: true/false"
```

## Testing Checklist

### Test 1: Normal Flow (No Cancellation)
- [ ] Start setup
- [ ] Wait for completion
- [ ] Verify button does NOT appear (zip cleaned up)
- [ ] Check logs for "‚úì Project data saved after untracking"

### Test 2: Cancellation During Zip Creation
- [ ] Start setup
- [ ] Cancel DURING zip creation (while "Zipping files...")
- [ ] Verify button DOES appear after cancellation
- [ ] Check project data file for tracked zip
- [ ] Check logs for "‚úì Tracked zip file in project entity"

### Test 3: Project Switch with Tracked Zips
- [ ] Have a project with tracked zips
- [ ] Switch to different project (no zips)
- [ ] Verify button hidden
- [ ] Switch back to project with zips
- [ ] Verify button appears
- [ ] Check logs for "Cleanup button visibility updated: true"

### Test 4: App Restart Persistence
- [ ] Start setup and cancel during zip creation
- [ ] Verify button appears
- [ ] Close application
- [ ] Restart application
- [ ] Select same project
- [ ] Verify button STILL appears (data persisted)

### Test 5: Manual Cleanup
- [ ] Click cleanup button
- [ ] Verify dialog shows tracked zip
- [ ] Select and delete
- [ ] Verify button disappears after cleanup
- [ ] Restart app and verify button stays hidden

## Debug Logging Added

Look for these log messages:

### Tracking:
```
‚úì Tracked zip file in project entity: /tmp/downloaded_java_123.zip
‚úì Project data saved after tracking zip file
```

### Untracking:
```
Removed zip file from tracking: /tmp/downloaded_java_123.zip
‚úì Project data saved after untracking zip file
```

### Button Visibility:
```
Cleanup button visibility updated: true
```

### Cleanup:
```
Cleaning up remote zip after cancellation: /tmp/downloaded_java_123.zip
Remote zip file cleaned up successfully
‚úì Project data saved after cleanup
```

## Benefits of These Fixes

1. **‚úì Immediate Tracking**: Zip tracked the moment path is created
2. **‚úì Survives Cancellation**: Even if user cancels, zip is already tracked
3. **‚úì Persists Across Restarts**: All changes saved immediately to disk
4. **‚úì Accurate Button State**: Button always shows correct state after project switch
5. **‚úì No Orphaned Files**: All zips tracked, even if operations fail
6. **‚úì Audit Trail**: Complete logging of all tracking operations
7. **‚úì Safe Cleanup**: User can verify and clean up any leftover files

---

## Files Changed in This Fix

1. **SFTPDownloadAndUnzip.java**
   - Moved tracking to start of createZipFile()
   - Added auto-save after every tracking change
   - Total changes: 7 locations

2. **ProjectDetailsController.java**
   - Moved button visibility update to finally block
   - Added logging for visibility changes
   - Total changes: 2 locations

---

## No Breaking Changes

- ‚úì All existing functionality preserved
- ‚úì Backward compatible with existing project data
- ‚úì No changes to public APIs
- ‚úì No changes to UI layout
- ‚úì Only internal tracking logic improved

---

## Recommended Next Test

1. Run a setup and cancel during zip creation
2. Watch the logs for the sequence:
   ```
   ‚úì Tracked zip file in project entity
   ‚úì Project data saved after tracking zip file
   (user cancels)
   Cleaning up remote zip after cancellation
   Removed zip file from tracking
   ‚úì Project data saved after cleanup
   ```
3. Check that button appears/disappears correctly
4. Restart app and verify persistence
