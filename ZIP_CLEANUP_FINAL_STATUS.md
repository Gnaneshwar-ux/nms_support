# Zip Cleanup Feature - Final Status & Testing Guide

## ✅ All Issues Fixed!

### Issue 1: Cleanup Button Not Visible on Project Switch
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

**What was wrong:**
- Button visibility was checked during loading, before project data was fully loaded
- Change tracking service interfered with UI updates

**How it's fixed:**
- Button visibility now updates in `finally` block AFTER loading completes
- Checks project.hasServerZipFiles() and updates button accordingly
- Logs: "Cleanup button visibility updated: true/false"

**Location:** `ProjectDetailsController.java` lines 258-268

---

### Issue 2: Zip Files Not Tracked When User Cancels
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

**What was wrong:**
- Zip path tracking happened AFTER createZipFile() completed
- If user cancelled DURING zip creation, tracking never happened
- Orphaned zips left on server with no way to find them

**How it's fixed:**
- Tracking now happens IMMEDIATELY when zip path is created (line 460)
- Happens BEFORE actual zip command executes
- Even if user cancels mid-creation, zip is already tracked
- Logs: "✓ Tracked zip file in project entity: /tmp/downloaded_java_XXX.zip"

**Location:** `SFTPDownloadAndUnzip.java` lines 459-462

---

### Issue 3: Tracking Data Not Persisted
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

**What was wrong:**
- Tracking changes weren't saved to disk
- On app restart, tracked zips would be lost
- Button state would be incorrect after restart

**How it's fixed:**
- Added `finally` block in `SetupService.executeSetup()` that ALWAYS saves
- Saves occur even on cancellation or failure
- `ZipCleanupDialog` already saves after cleanup operations
- Logs: "✓ Project data saved in finally block (ensures zip tracking is persisted)"

**Location:** `SetupService.java` lines 636-647

## 🧪 Complete Testing Guide

### Test 1: Normal Flow (No Issues)
**Expected:** Button should NOT appear

1. Start "Local Setup / Upgrade"
2. Wait for completion
3. **Verify:** Button is NOT visible (zip was cleaned up)
4. **Check logs for:**
   ```
   ✓ Tracked zip file in project entity: /tmp/downloaded_java_XXX.zip
   Remote zip file deleted successfully
   Removed zip file from tracking
   ```

---

### Test 2: User Cancels DURING Zip Creation  
**Expected:** Button SHOULD appear

1. Start "Local Setup / Upgrade"
2. **Cancel immediately when you see:** "Zipping files... (X files processed)"
3. Wait for cancellation to complete
4. **Verify:** "Cleanup Server Temp Files" button IS visible
5. **Check logs for:**
   ```
   ✓ Tracked zip file in project entity: /tmp/downloaded_java_XXX.zip
   Zip cancelled during execution, cleaning up...
   ✓ Project data saved in finally block
   ```
6. **Verify in project data file** (JSON): Check if zip is listed in `serverZipFiles`

---

### Test 3: Project Switch Shows/Hides Button
**Expected:** Button state updates correctly

1. Have Project A with tracked zips (cancel a setup)
2. Have Project B with no tracked zips
3. Switch from A → B
   - **Verify:** Button HIDES
   - **Check logs:** "Cleanup button visibility updated: false"
4. Switch from B → A
   - **Verify:** Button APPEARS
   - **Check logs:** "Cleanup button visibility updated: true"

---

### Test 4: Manual Cleanup Works
**Expected:** Files get deleted and button hides

1. Have a project with tracked zips (cancel a setup)
2. **Verify:** Button is visible
3. Click "Cleanup Server Temp Files"
4. Dialog shows tracked zips with:
   - Full path
   - Size
   - Creation date
   - Status (green = exists, red = missing)
5. Select files and click "Clean Up Selected"
6. Confirm deletion
7. **Verify:** 
   - Dialog shows "Successfully deleted X file(s)"
   - Button HIDES after closing dialog
8. **Check logs:**
   ```
   Successfully deleted zip file: /tmp/downloaded_java_XXX.zip
   Project data saved after cleanup operation
   ```

---

### Test 5: App Restart Persistence
**Expected:** Tracked zips survive app restart

1. Start setup and cancel during zip creation
2. **Verify:** Button appears
3. **Close the application completely**
4. **Restart the application**
5. Select the same project
6. **Verify:** Button STILL appears
7. Click cleanup button
8. **Verify:** Same zip files are shown in dialog

---

### Test 6: Cleanup Handles Missing Files
**Expected:** Missing files removed from tracking automatically

1. Have tracked zips in a project
2. **Manually delete** the zip file on server via SSH
3. Click "Cleanup Server Temp Files"
4. **Verify:** Dialog shows file with RED status "✗ Not found"
5. **Verify:** Message says "will be removed from tracking"
6. Close dialog
7. **Verify:** Button HIDES (no more tracked files)

##  Critical Log Messages to Watch

### When Tracking Happens:
```
✓ Tracked zip file in project entity: /tmp/downloaded_java_XXX.zip
⚠️ Note: Project data will be auto-saved by SetupService after operation completes
```

### When Saving Happens:
```
✓ Project data saved in finally block (ensures zip tracking is persisted)
```

### When Button Updates:
```
Cleanup button visibility updated: true
```

### When Cleanup Occurs:
```
Removed zip file from tracking: /tmp/downloaded_java_XXX.zip
Project data saved after cleanup operation
```

---

## 🔍 How to Debug Issues

### Button Not Showing When It Should:
1. Check project JSON file for `serverZipFiles` array
2. Look for log: "Cleanup button visibility updated: false" (should be true)
3. Verify `serverZipCleanupBtn` field is not null in controller
4. Check if `loadProjectDetails()` finally block executed

### Button Showing When It Shouldn't:
1. Check project JSON file - should have empty `serverZipFiles: []`
2. Look for cleanup logs that might have failed
3. Manually check server for leftover files in `/tmp/`

### Tracking Not Persisting After Restart:
1. Check if "Project data saved in finally block" appears in logs
2. Verify project JSON file was actually written to disk
3. Check file permissions on project data file

### Cleanup Dialog Not Finding Files:
1. Verify SSH connection works
2. Check if zip path in tracking matches actual server path
3. Look for connection errors in logs during scan

## 🎯 Key Takeaways

✅ **Tracking is immediate** - happens the moment path is created  
✅ **Survives cancellation** - tracked even if user cancels mid-operation  
✅ **Always persisted** - finally block ensures data is saved  
✅ **Button state accurate** - updates properly on project switch  
✅ **No orphaned files** - all zips tracked and can be cleaned up

## 🚀 Ready to Test!

The implementation is complete and ready for testing. Follow the test cases above to verify everything works correctly. All critical scenarios are covered:
- Normal flow (no issues)
- User cancellation
- Project switching
- App restart
- Manual cleanup
- Missing file handling

**Start with Test 2** (User Cancels During Zip Creation) - this is the most important scenario that was broken before!
